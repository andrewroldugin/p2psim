Disclaimer
----------
This is a pre alpha version of p2psim. We would value your feedback with
suggestions and improvements.

Requirements
------------
We compile and run p2psim on Linux and FreeBSD with GCC 2.95.3 and GCC 3.3.2.
However, we recommend using GCC 2.95.3. In addition, you need the openssl
header files (libssl-dev package in Debian), and you need libcrypto.

Compile p2psim
--------------
tar xvfz p2psim-0.1.tar.gz
cd p2psim-0.1
./configure
make

(use gmake instead of make on FreeBSD)

The binary (p2psim) will be in the p2psim/ subdirectory.
